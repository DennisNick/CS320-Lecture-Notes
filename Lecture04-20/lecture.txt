April 20th Notes
----------------

There's some stuff about graph marking today.

Can either do with a hash table or another Board for style programming.

-> Marking differs from Breadth First Search in Order.
  > BFS as given in the quiz is order sensitive.
  > Marking means a search is insensitive.
  > If order matters, you'll need a Heuristic.

val Marked = myhashtbl_make_nil(1024)
val-cons0(w, _) = nx
val-~None_vt() = theMarked.insert(w,0)

Runtime checking is crucial. Particularly for imperative programming.

"Continuation" Talk:
--------------------
-> Some Javascript talk too. 
-> Important to know the computational model of any language as you start it.
-> Humanity is selfish, we're talking ethics now. 
-> Javascript schdule handling supposedly waits for completion of an application.
-> Run and stop, run and stop is the way for doing animating programming
-> "Continuation" - Resuming a form of execution after meeting a stop point and returning.
-> Essentially, think running to a save point, going to a different program, than back
-> All about that checkpoint.
