April 11th Notes

Doublets
--------
-> In terms of actual computation for this puzzle, we'd need a dictionayr and a track of
  > two other terms.

-> We need to be able to explain the code too. 
-> Don't overthink the problem.

-> Being vague from the programmer's perspective allows for code to adapt in differing 
  > settings and across other ways.

Alan Kay: Extreme late bindings of all forms, try and postpone making a commitment.

-> May need some format of Memoization for this.
-> Marking the Nodes is also a pretty useful thing.
-> Path retention in a Queue like struct would also work. Simply keep aware of cycles.

-> There is a lot of flexibility with late-binding here.
-> The sats file will specify the kind of functions you want, *cough* C header file *cough*
-> The dats file is the actual implementation, *cough* normal C file *cough*

-> Branching on AI territory here, with need for Heuristics and the like
